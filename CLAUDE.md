# Agent Teams Eval — Architecture Design (ate-arch)

## Overview

Experimental comparison of Claude Code with Agent Teams (symmetric peers) vs
default Claude Code (hub-and-spoke subagents) for SW architecture design with
simulated stakeholder requirements gathering. 2 architectures × 3 partition
conditions × 5 runs = 30 total runs. 4-layer rubric scoring.

Third in the ate series. Predecessors found ceiling effects and zero
communication on bug-fixing (ate) and feature implementation (ate-features).
This experiment structures information asymmetry by construction to force
cross-agent communication.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+ with uv
- Pydantic for data models
- Typer for CLI
- PyYAML for config
- pytest + ruff + mypy (strict)
- hatchling build backend

## Conventions

- TDD: tests before code, validation gates (`make test`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`)
- No Co-Authored-By in commits
- Phase branches off main, user merges manually
- `docs/experiment-design.md` is the north star
- Raw data in `data/` (gitignored contents), config in `config/` (committed)
- Dependency groups: core (always), dev (always), scoring (Phase 4+), analysis (Phase 7+)

## Current State

**Phase 0 complete.** Project scaffold created with Pydantic models, config
loader, CLI skeleton, and initial unit tests.

## Phases

| Phase | Branch | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0 | `phase-0-scaffold` | In Progress |
| 1 | `phase-1-scenario` | Pending |
| 2 | `phase-2-simulator` | Pending |
| 3 | `phase-3-harness` | Pending |
| 4 | `phase-4-rubric` | Pending |
| 5 | `phase-5-pilot` | Pending |
| 6 | `phase-6-execution` | Pending |
| 7 | `phase-7-analysis` | Pending |

## Known Gotchas

- pyproject.toml: `dependencies` must come before `[project.scripts]` in the
  `[project]` table, otherwise hatchling fails with a confusing error
